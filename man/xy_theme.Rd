\arguments{
\item{font_size}{The base font size in points for fonts and other graphical elements.
\code{font_size} is directly the size of the x- and y-axis titles.
Default is \code{12}.}

\item{font_family}{The font family used in the graph.
Default is an empty string (\code{""}), a sans-serif font.}

\item{font_size_scale}{A default scale factor for non-axis-title fonts.
Default is \code{0.8}.
Change this parameter if you want to change the size
of all non-axis-title text.}

\item{spacing_scale}{A default scale factor for spacing between text and axes.
Default is \code{0.2}.}

\item{x_axis_labels_spacing}{The distance between x axis labels and the x axis itself in points.
Default is \code{spacing_scale*font_size}, normally 2.4 points.}

\item{y_axis_labels_spacing}{The distance between y axis labels and the y axis itself in points.
Default is \code{spacing_scale*font_size}, normally 2.4 points.}

\item{x_strip_labels_spacing}{The distance between x strip text
(labels at the top of a faceted plot) and
the top border of the individual graphs
in points.
Default is \code{spacing_scale*font_size}, normally 2.4 points,
to leave space for descenders.}

\item{y_strip_labels_spacing}{The distance between y strip text
(labels to the right of a faceted plot) and
the right border of the individual graphs
in points.
Default is \code{spacing_scale*font_size}, normally 2.4 points,
to leave space for descenders.}

\item{tick_length}{The tick length in points. Default is \code{-1.5*spacing_scale*font_size}, normally -3.6 points,
so the ticks will be slightly longer than
the spacing between text and borders.
Negative tick length indicates the ticks
should be placed inside the graph, where ticks belong!}

\item{border_and_label_colour}{The colour for borders and labels. Default is "gray50".}
}
\description{
This function provides a graphical style for \code{ggplot2} that includes
\itemize{
\item gray axes,
\item gray tic marks,
\item inward-pointing tic marks,
\item right-justified y-axis labels,
\item no grid lines, and
\item white background.
}
}
\details{
By default, the font size for axis titles is set by \code{font_size}.
The font size for all other text elements is scaled relative to \code{font_size},
by default 80\% smaller than the axis titles.
Adjust \code{font_size_scale} if 80\% is not to your liking.

Spacing between graphical elements can be specified with more precision
using this function.
\code{spacing_scale} adjusts spacing relative to \code{font_size} for all
graphical elements.
But spacing between axis labels and strip labels and nearby
graph borders can also be specified individually.
See the vignette for examples.
